      Do you remember the last time you booked a holiday? Dit it all go as smooth as silk or were there any hiccups?  
    </h3>
  
   <p class="mt-5">Maybe a little miscommunication with the hotel, or a discrepancy between the room shown online and the reality of it, or the different perception of "short distance" to the local amnesties - which ends up in you purchasing an unexpected new pair of shoes because the sole of yours is gone... <br/><br/>
    The point is that, sometimes, there can be unnecessary hiccups during the booking process that turn the dream of a holiday into a frustrating experience. Other times there isn't much anyone can do about the hiccup so you zen out and carry on.</p>

    <p class="mt-3">With this in mind, if I were to build a hotel tomorrow, how would I design the booking process to provide a kick-ass experience? </p>

          „ÉªI started by researching the dos and don't adopt by the experts in the field by running competitive benchmarking research. <em>It helped me establish the conventional flow, identify strengths & points and find inspiration to fix those pain points.</em><br/><br/>

  <p>To understand how people feel about the booking process I run a series of Usability tests. I also run a series of Usability tests to understand how people feel when booking a hotel. As a window on the destination, the website needs to fulfil the psychological aspect by capturing the person's attention and the technical aspects by providing a smooth experience from start to end. <br/><br/> 
            <em>Findings included: understanding the subtle yet pivotal role of images in creating or re-inforcing first impressions, the person's immediate vs non-essential needs, the importance of presenting clear information, and the balance between suggesting options and being pushy. </em></p>

    <strong> ‚òÄÔ∏è Analysis -</strong> <br/><br/>
          „ÉªThrough the verbal and non-verbal insights gathered in the usability tests, I draw a map of the customer's journey and <em>identify the areas creating friction between the person's goal and the system.</em> Although the main pain points proved to occur during the room search and adds-on, the lack of other details in the previous pages didn't help the overall experience. <br/><br/>
          „ÉªCreating an affinity diagram by reporting the data gathered during the research phase helped to visualize them and then group them according to their similarities. <br/><br/>
          <em>Moreover, this helped pinpoint connections between pain points raised in the usability tests and potential solutions identified in the competitive benchmarking.</em><br/><br/>

    <strong> üå∏ Design -</strong> <br/><br/>
 „ÉªWhat the research and analisys revealed, is that people know what they want and appreiate getting there easily and smoothly, unless there are offers on the table. Any unwanted distraction can provoke frustration, annoyance, and eventually the decision to opt for a different hotel. For these reasons, I decided that a minimal, aesthetically pleasing, and efficient design would be my mantra. <br/>
     <p>Psychological aspects taken into account when designing: <br/> 
 
„ÉªHigh quality images proved to be critical in triggering peoples' attention and developing a first impression. Moreover, data showed that people like to know what the hotel offers but even more they appreciate the hotel 'pro-actively' recommending local activities and businesses. Hence the display of images showing the hotel amenities as well as of local activities too boost the person's interest.  <br/>
„ÉªProvide clear information or people might be think the business it's a little bit shady. Also true that too much information can be overwhelming.<br/>
„Éª Be as transparent as you can. <br/><br/>
 Technical aspects taken into account: <br/>
„Éª A grid system works best when comparing items, like when choosing which room to book.<br/>
„Éª Maximise clarity and minimise room for misunderstanding by using icons showing the captions when hovered for the room's description. <br/>
„Éª Chunking the details and payment form to make it more digestable. <br/>
