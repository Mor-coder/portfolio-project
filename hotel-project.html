      Do you remember the last time you booked a holiday? Did it all go as smooth as silk or were there any hiccups?  
    </h3>
  
   <p class="mt-5">Maybe a little miscommunication with the hotel, or a discrepancy between the room shown online and the reality of it, or the different perception of "short distance" to the local amnesties - which ends up in you purchasing an unexpected new pair of shoes because the sole of yours is gone... <br/><br/>
    The point is that, sometimes, there can be unnecessary hiccups during the booking process that turn the dream of a holiday into a frustrating experience.</p>

        Through the verbal and non-verbal insights gathered in the usability tests, I draw a map of the customer's journey and <em>identify the areas creating friction between the person's goal and the system.</em> Although the main pain points proved to occur during the room search and adds-on, the lack of other details in the previous pages didn't help the overall experience. <br/><br/></p>

 What the research and analisys revealed, is that people know what they want and appreciate getting there easily and smoothly, that is without having to think about too much about the process. Unless there are offers on the table, any unwanted distraction can provoke frustration, annoyance, and eventually the decision to opt for a different hotel. For these reasons, I decided that a minimal, aesthetically pleasing, and efficient design would be my mantra. <br/><br/>

<h3 class="text-center mt-5">What I did -</h3> 
<p class="mt-3">
  „ÉªDesign a progressive menu to show the overall booking steps as well as the users progression in the process. Each icon changes color mirroring users' advancement.<br/>
  „ÉªDisplay the 'Special Offers' window as soon as possible as research show that users will have a look, even if it is just to have a look. <br/>
  „ÉªTwo boxes respectively for 'Arrival' & 'Departure' displaying dates with BIG numbers to make it easy on the eyes. <br/>
  „ÉªBIG buttons to enhance their function. Label informing of what will be next 'Find a room' or 'Confirm and continue'. <br/>
  „ÉªOne calendar for 'Arrival' and one for 'Departure' to avoid the confusion and friction caused by having both displayed at the same time.<br/>

  „ÉªDesign a grid system to display the available rooms instead of listing them one on top of the other. Research showed that users find it easier to look and compare rooms when in a grid instead of having to scroll up and down. <br/>
  „ÉªRespond to primary users needs by displaying the basic room amnesties in the form of icons as well as showing a written description when the icon is hovered. <br/>
  „ÉªProvide a full room description, including room size to answer any of the questions users could have about the room.<br/>
  „ÉªDesign a slideshow to show images of the room (including bathroom and/or other areas) to help providing a close-to-real view of the room. This would re-inforce users' trust as they feel they are closer to know what they are getting.

  „ÉªOnce the room has been selected (IMPORTANT as the system doesn't want to be perceived as "TOO PUSHY"), then offer any 'Adds-on'.<br/>
  „ÉªResearch showed that users appreciate the hotel to be pro-active and facilitate the discovery of local amnesties/activities. For this reason I decided to make it part of the hotel's mission to offer adds-on experiences in partnership with local businesses. <br/>
  „ÉªOnce the user selects the desired adds-on, a little window will pop-up providing feedback to the call of action. <br/>
  „ÉªIf the user selects 2 guests at the early stage of the booking, some adds-on (i.e. Dinner) will automatically be booked for 2 in the effort to make the system pro-active.<br/>
  „ÉªIn the summary, design a button (+ / -) giving the user the option to opt out in case they decide to change booking completely or change room.<br/>
  „ÉªProvide a breakdown of the chosen options + prices in the summary to enhance transparency and a sense of trustworthiness in the system.
