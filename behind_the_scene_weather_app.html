    <title>Behind the scene of the Weather App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <div class="intro">
        <p class="intro-1">Weather App Project</p>
        <p class="intro-2">
          As my main objective was learning how to code <br />
          and integrate API in my project, I opted for <br />
          creating proto-persona based on observation <br />
          and informal conversations with people.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-3">
          Instead of asking direct questions on their app use, I would start
          with some small talk (literally about the weather!), grasping
          informations on how this is affecting their day. From there, the
          conversation would follow a natural flow where more details on how the
          weather impact their day to day routine would be revealed.
          <br /><br />Finally I would ask if they rely on any weather app. Given
          that weather forecast has the reputation of not being 100% accurate
          and temperatures are perceived differently by each individual, it was
          curious and intriguing understanding how different individual engage
          with weather app and for what purposes.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="behind-the-scene-text">
        <div class="prototypes">
          <p class="css">
            Based on those observations I noticed that slang phrases, such as
            "It's raining cats and dogs", are as frequently used as the more
            traditional ones and, funny enough, may be more effective in
            delivering the message.<br /><br />
            On the other hand, temperature expressed in degrees, proved a bit
            trickier as each person perceives it differently, although
            he/she/they would still have a general idea of the weather
            conditions.
            <br /><br />
            NOTES: Although phrases might be more effective, they are specific
            to the geographical location they are used making them less
            appropriate for a global audience.<br /><br />
            Degrees, on the other hand, are universal numbers largerly
            understood by a greater majority.

      <div class="behind-the-scenes-text-1">
        <div class="prototypes_1">
          <p class="css_1">
            Once moved away from the idea of adding descriptive elements and
            embracing the more traditional numerical one, I worked few technical
            bits:
          </p>
          <div class="prototypes_1_li">
            <ul>
              <li>
                Added the WIND condition as it is pivotal for those living on
                boats (This I learned from one of the testing session).
              </li>
              <li>
                I also added HUMIDITY and a SHORT DESCRIPTION to improve the
                general idea of the weather condition and hopefully allow people
                to get a better idea of the temperaure they will experience.
              </li>
              <li>
                Enabled the pointer option when the cursor moves on "Search" to
                re-inforce the button feature.
              </li>
              <li>
                Played around with the background colour trying different
                gradient options. As the app is showing the weather forecats, I
                liked for the app background to resemble the colour of the sky,
                possibly a clear sky above the clouds (like the one you
                experience when flying up a plane). However, I also wanted it to
                somehow interact with the main page background, so eventually I
                came to a conclusion that connected the one with the other.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="thumbnails_1">
            <img src="img/weather-app.png" alt="" />
            <img src="img/weather-app-1.png" alt="" />
            <img src="img/weather-app-2.png" alt="" />
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="last-p">
          For the main page I opted for a black background with two
          yellow/orange half circles on the left, while for the app background I
          decided to animate gradient colours going from warm to cold color
          variations. The idea is to reproduce the daily motion of the earth
          around the sun, going from morning to evening.
