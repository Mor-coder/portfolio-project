    <title>Behind the scene of the Weather App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <div class="intro">
        <p class="intro-1">Weather App Project</p>
        <p class="intro-2">
          As my main objective was learning how to code <br />
          and integrate API in my project, I didn't literally <br />
          follow the UX design process. Instead, I opted for <br />
          taking bits and bobs from each of the five steps <br />
          and integrate them in the design/coding process.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-3">
          I created persona based on observation and informal conversations with
          people. Starting with small talk (literally about the weather!), I
          collected informations on how this might be affecting their day. From
          there, the conversation would follow a natural flow revealing in more
          details how the weather impact their day to day routine, or has had an
          impact in organising special occasions.
          <br /><br />Finally I would ask if they rely on any weather app. Given
          that in general the weather forecast is perceived as not 100% accurate
          and temperatures are perceived differently by each individual, it was
          curious and intriguing understanding how people engage with weather
          apps, for what purposes, and how much they rely on them.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="behind-the-scene-text">
        <div class="prototypes">
          <p class="css">
            On top of those observations I noticed that slang phrases, such as
            "It's raining cats and dogs", are frequently used to describe the
            weather conditions and, funny enough, may be more effective in
            delivering the message.<br /><br />
            By contrast, temperatures expressed more traditionally in degrees,
            proved a bit tricky as each person perceives them differently,
            although he/she/they would still have a general idea of the weather
            conditions.
            <br /><br />
            NOTES: Although slang phrases might be more effective, they are
            specific to the geographical location they are used, making them
            less appropriate for a global audience.<br /><br />
            Degrees, on the other hand, are universal numbers largerly
            understood by a greater majority.

      <div class="behind-the-scenes-text-1">
        <div class="prototypes_1">
          <p class="css_1">
            Once moved away from the idea of adding descriptive elements and
            embracing the more classic numerical one, I worked on a few
            technical elements:
          </p>
          <div class="prototypes_1_li">
            <ul>
              <li>
                One of the testing session taught me that many people decided to
                live on the canal waters and the WIND condition is as important
                as refilling the water/gas tank.
              </li>
              <li>
                To improve the general idea of the weather condition, and
                hopefully allow people to get a better feeling of the outdoor
                temperaure, I also added HUMIDITY and a SHORT DESCRIPTION.
              </li>
              <li>
                To re-inforce the button feature, I enabled the pointer option
                when the cursor moves on "Search".
              </li>
              <li>
                Then, I had some fun playing around with the web page background
                and the app background. As the app is showing the weather
                forecats, I liked for the background to resemble the colour of
                the sky, possibly a clear sky above the clouds (like the one you
                see when flying up in the sky). On top of that, I wanted it to
                somehow interact with the main page background, so I tried few
                options mainly portraying different the sky at different times
                of the day, like sunsets or sunrise (adding to them a pinch of
                fantasy).
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="thumbnails_1">
            <img src="img/weather-app.png" alt="" />
            <img src="img/weather-app-1.png" alt="" />
            <img src="img/weather-app-2.png" alt="" />
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="last-p">
          Eventually, I recalibrated the whole situation and changed
          persepective slightly. For the main page I opted for a black
          background, like the universe, with two half circles coloured in
          different hues of orange on the left representing the sun. For the app
          background, I animated background with gradient colours going from
          warm to cold variations in an infinite loop. The idea was to reproduce
          the daily motion of the earth around the sun, going from morning to
          evening.
