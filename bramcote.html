        The Bramcote Old Church Tower's website re-design - behind the scene
      </h2>
      <h3 class="mt-5">The context -</h3>
      <p>
        This work came about as a friend told me about her involvement in the
        13th-century Bramcote Old Church Tower and the surrounding
        de-consecrated graveyard restoration and maintenance. As a former art
        professional, I was intrigued by the project and went on the website to
        gather further information. After a first browse, I noticed that the
        church's history, a substantial detail, was missing altogether. The lack
        of this information made me wonder whether it was an intentional
        decision and what was the website's architectural information. Which
        needs were they trying to answer? After liaising with the charity's web
        designer and understanding the criteria used to structure the website, I
        suggested sending out an online survey and running a series of usability
        tests. The idea was to learn how people felt about the product now, its
        strength and pain points and how to implement those areas needing love.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mt-5">The process -</h3>
      <p>
        In the fictional scenario, the user was interested in visiting the site
        and wanted to learn about the history and the ongoing project
        beforehand. They also wanted to know about the events and how to get
        involved in charity work. The first finding, the first headache - The
        usability test helped me understand where they expected to find the
        History section based on the mental model they've built through their
        experiences navigating websites with similar content. Participants
        looked for the History link in the global navigation bar next to the
        link The Project or as the link containing The Project. The History and
        The Project are related but to what extent? Would it be better to group
        History and Archaeology while separately showing The Project with its
        subcategories or creating a bespoke page for History and maintaining the
        rest as it was? The answer to this was to create various designs and
        test them again. The second finding was a little bit less of a headache
        - While reading the book Don't make me think by Steve Krug, I stumbled
        upon a question in which he invited the user to tell what struck them
        about the page, what they thought the website was about, how to navigate
        the page, and what kind of information were they receiving. Apart from
        comments on the aesthetic, it quickly appeared that the page needed to
        display a fundamental piece of information: directions and opening
        times. Their reaction made perfect sense! Imagine looking at a heritage
        site's website, falling in love with the pictures, getting excited to go
        for a trip, and then losing all your goodwill to find out how and when
        to get there. Struggle no more! To solve this problem, I used the
        competitive benchmarking research method to learn how the best in the
        world go about it. That showed me how certain information is repeated on
        multiple pages to improve the user flow and avoid making the person go
        back and forth from page to page.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mt-5">Last but not least -</h3>
      <p>
        As mentioned, the charity that runs the Project is all volunteers based
        and apart from the events and memberships, donations are the other
        source of revenue. The BIG sensitive question - How can we prompt people
        to donate without being too pushy? The usability testing and asking
        people to talk about their previous experiences donating to a similar
        charity helped identify the triggers that could lead to a donation.
        While there are no fixed rules when supporting a cause, most users said
        that if they know where their contribution is going, they are happy to
        contribute. The solution, let's show them what we do!
