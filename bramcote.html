        The Bramcote Old Church Tower's website re-design - behind the scene

      <p class="bramcote-p mt-5">
        Archaeological sites are like a portal to the past. They allow you to have a blurred sneak peek into the history of humanity. Nevertheless, despite their role as history representatives, they don't always receive the care and attention they deserve.<br/><br/>   

        The de-consecrated 13th-century Bramcote Old Church Tower and the surrounding graveyard are one of those sites that, thanks to the dedication and passion of the local community still have a story to tell. <br/><br/>
        
        The desire to translate in the website the enthusiasm and hard work that the Friends of the Old Church Tower Trust puts daily into this project is what prompted me to offer my help to redesign the website.

      <h2>Act 2: The research </h2>
      <h3 class="mt-3">Dig deeper, build empathy -</h3>
      <p class="bramcote-p mt-5">
       Comes first, I sat down with the web designer to discuss the what's, the whys and the hows behind the website's structure. Slowly but surely, more information on the website and the project's past, present, and future came to the surface, allowing me to grasp the Trust's mission and identity.       
       We opted for runnig a series of Usability tests to identify how people felt about the website and to unfold the following:
       <ul class="questions">
         <li>Do people know who we are and what we do?</li>
          <li>We need to add a new page called "History". Where should it go?</li>
          <li>Do people know how to reach us?</li>
          <li>Do they know the Trust run events and how to participate? </li> 
        </ul>

        <p class="bramcote-p">as well as more sensitive questions, like: </p>

         <ul class="questions">
            <li>How do we motivate people to get involved?</li>
            <li>How can we prompt them to donate without being too pushy?</li>
        </ul> 
      </p>


      <h3 class="mt-3">The findings -</h3>

      <p class="bramcote-p mt-3">
        The Usability tests produced significant and insightful data that start shaping the face of the soon-to-be refreshed website. These included: <br/><br/>
        <strong>・Homepage -</strong> Participants' immediate needs included finding the directions to the site and useful information such as, opening hours, parking availability, and contacts. <br/>
        <strong>・New page -</strong> When asked to look for the 'History' page (although still not existing) participants naturally look at the global navbar expecting to find the link there. <em>Understanding their mental model was a significant cue for our re-design.</em> <br/>
        <strong>・Events page -</strong> The events page also need further details on how to participate. <br/>
        <strong>・Donation & Getting involved -</strong> The tests showed that people are willing to get involved and donate if it is clear how the funds will be used and what for. <br/><br/>

        Competitive benchmarking, on the other hand, showed me that there seems to be conventional guidelines to websites' structure for cultural institutions. This finding was gold as it provided clear guidelines most likely matching peoples' mental model resulting in a smoother experience while navigating the site. 
      </p> 


       <h3 class="mt-5">The challenges -</h3>
       <p class="bramcote-p mt-3">
       ・Design a product that could be reproduced on Wordpress, the platform used by the Trust, and that it wasn't too complicated to implement. <br/>
       ・Designing a Homepage that offers a comprehensive idea of the Trust and the activities undertaken to preserve the archaelogical site.
       ・Incorporate elements such as directions and useful information on the Homepage and Events page without looking repetitive.  <br/>
       ・Design the new 'History' page and find it a home. <br/>
       ・Prompt public's donations/participation.

         <h3>What I did - </h3>
         <p>・Give more space to the slideshow showing full screen images of the tower instead of half image. <br/>
            ・Crate a new section showing the Trust's statement next to all the relevant information including directions and accessibility responding to users' immediate. I've also added a picture of a past art installation project to show the various events and possibilities the Trust offers. <br/>
            ・Change the background colour to off-white to create more contrast between the background and the objects in the page. <br/>
            ・Kept Marcello brand font for the navbar tabs and main titles and used Montserrat for text to enhance the information hierarchy. <br/>

          ・This section is strictly connected to the following one (How to get involved) as it provides transparent information on how the Trust uses funds to promote activities aimed at the preservation of the site.<br/>
          ・Unfortunately the 360° video of the tower wasn't working so even though the video was a lovely idea, that section was wasted. Instead, I added the brand new section 'History', finally filling the need of people to find information on the site's history. <br/>
          ・Following are all the activities the Trust undertakes to preserve and maintain the Tower. I used thumbnails as they speak louder than words and are more likely to grab a person's attention.

         ・Added a new section with a map to the site, directions (by car and by bus), and other relevant information.

            ・Group together 'Events & News' in one page, however have them divided into 2 separate rows to give them space and a neat look. <br/>
            ・As the news are often related to past events, it made sense to have them together as opposed to separate pages with no connection with each other.<br/>
            ・Show the map at the bottom of the page again pre-actively answering the user's need of directions.

        <p>
        ・Add the page 'The History', which was missing altogether and group it together with 'The Project' as they are strictly related (this point was also supported during the research phase when users were asked to look for the History page) <br/>
        ・As people tend to respond faster to images than text, I opted for creating a thumbnails grid showing in pictures the variety of activities supported by the Trust.<br/>
        ・I then added the 'How to get involved' section again as if people are interested in joining in, the system would be forward-thinking and present them with the available options. <br/>
        ・Last but not least, if the person still has questions and would like to contact the Trust, the form would be right there preventing the user from looking elsewhere and maybe get distracted and drop off.
