        The Bramcote Old Church Tower's website re-design - behind the scene
      </h2>
      <h3 class="mt-5">The context -</h3>
      <p class="bramcote-p">
        This work came about as a friend told me about her involvement in the
        restoration and maintanance of the de-consacrated 13th-century Bramcote
        Old Church Tower and the surrounding graveyard. As a former art
        professional I was thrilled by the project and in no-time
        I was online looking for more information.
      </p>

      <p class="bramcote-p">
        The website, although pretty functional and nicely designed, was in need of a fresh coat of paint and contents update. Nevertheless, before jumping into any actions, I needed context. <br/><br/>
        First comes first, I liaised with the Trust's web designer to understand the logic behind the website's structure - <strong>What were they aiming at conveying.</strong> Secondly, we discussed the areas of interest - <strong>What is important people learn from the website.</strong><br/>
        Thirdly, we agreed on a plan of actions - <strong>How to achieve the desired results.</strong>
      </p>

      
      <h3 class="mt-3">Dig deeper -</h3>
      <p class="bramcote-p">
        These conversations led to questions spanning from more practical issues such as: 
        <ul class="questions">
          <li>Where are we going to add the new History page?</li>
            <li>Do people know how to reach us?</li>
            <li>Do they know the Trust run events and how to participate? </li> 
        </ul>

        <p class="bramcote-p">to more sensitive ones, like: </p>

         <ul class="questions">
            <li>How do we motivate people to get involved?</li>
            <li>How can we prompt them to donate without being too pushy?</li>
        </ul> 
      </p>
      <p class="bramcote-p">
        Research method -  <br/>
        To answer our questions and learn how people felt about the website, its strength and pain points and how to
        implement those areas in need of love before committing to any changes, I suggested running a series of usability tests.
        The reason behind this choice was the need for genuine and insightful data gathered through verbal and non verbal communication. 
      </p>


      <h3 class="mt-3">The process -</h3>
      <p class="bramcote-p">
        In the usability testing, each participant was presented with a fictional scenario and asked to perform a series of tasks on the website aiming at providing answers to the quesitons above. While performing the tasks, the participants were asked to vocalise anything that crossed their mind, what actions they were about to perform and what were they expecting to achieve by doing so. 
      </p>


      <h3 class="mt-3">The findings -</h3>
      <p class="bramcote-p"><strong>Homepage</strong>: overall participants liked the aesthetic and the design of the website. 
        They quickly understood the nature of the site and the kind of information provided.
        The images provided a nice visual introduction to the site although it was suggested to use more images of the tower itself.<strong>Main pain-point:</strong> the need of immediate informations on directions, details, contacts, and a map.<br/><br/>

      <strong>Task 1</strong>: People expected to find the History link on the global navbar. Once they noticed it wasn't there, they opted to click on The Project dropdown menu. 
       Nevertheless, when asked what they were thinking, they answered they expected to find the link in the global navbar. <br/><br/>

       <strong>Task 2</strong>: When asked if they knew whether there were events happening the answer was positive. However, when asked to participate few questions came up: 
       <strong>Pain points: </strong>The most recurrent one was the need for immediate directions, infos and contacts. 
       <strong>Food for thoughts:</strong> picture create a buzz, perhaps it might be worth considering adding more images of the events (either in news or the event itself). <br/><br/>

      <strong>Task 3</strong>: How to get involved? Whether through subscription or donation, the main response was that there should be more informations on what are the funds used for. 
     <strong>Food for thoughts:</strong> Use an engaging way to communicate how the funds have and will be used and how can people get involved/reach out.
