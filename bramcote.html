      <h2 class="mt-5">
        The Bramcote Old Church Tower's website re-design - behind the scene
      </h2>
      <h3 class="mt-5">The context -</h3>
      <p>
        This work came about as a friend told me about her involvement in the
        restoration and maintanance of the de-consacrated 13th-century Bramcote
        Old Church Tower and the surrounding graveyard. The former art
        professional living inside me was thrilled by the project and in no-time
        I was on the website gathering further information.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a little bit of a geek, I looked for the 'History' section and to my
        surprise, I couldn't find it. Is it me or is this info missing? I had to
        solve this mystery. I was lucky enough to have the chance to liaise
        directly with the Trust's web designer, who confirmed my fear - the page
        was missing, it wasn't me.
      </p>

      <p>
        I then suggested, to take this chance and run some research to learn how
        people feel about the website, its strength and pain points and how to
        implement those areas in need of love. My go to was Usability testing as
        I feel it provides, through verbal and non-verbal communicaiton, genuine
        insights into a person's perspectives.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mt-3">Dig deeper -</h3>
      <p>
        While talking to my friend and the web designer, it became clear that
        understanding where to add the History section was only one of the
        questions to answer. Further questions included: 
        <ul class="questions">
            <li>Do people know how to reach us?</li>
            <li>Do they know the Trust run events and how to participate? </li>
            <li>Do they know how to get involved?</li>
            <li>How can we prompt people to donate without being too pushy?</li>
        </ul> 
      </p>
      <h3 class="mt-3">The process -</h3>
      <p>In the usability testing, each participant was presented with a fictional scenario and asked to perform a series of tasks on the website aiming at providing answers to the quesitons above. 
      </p>
      <h3 class="mt-3">The findings -</h3>
      <p><strong>Homepage</strong>: overall participants liked the aesthetic and the design of the website. 
        They quickly understood the nature of the site and the kind of information provided.
        The images provided a nice visual introduction to the site although it was suggested to use more images of the tower itself. <br/><br/>

        <strong>Main pain-point:</strong> the need of immediate informations on how to get there (by car and public transport) details (i.e. opening hours, free entry, public services) contacts, and a map in the homepage.<br/><br/>
     <strong>Task 1</strong>: People expected to find the History link on the global navbar. Once they noticed it wasn't there, they opted to click on The Project dropdown menu. 
       Nevertheless, when asked what they were thinking, they answered they expected to find the link in the global navbar. <br/><br/>

       <strong>Task 2</strong>: When asked if they knew whether there were events happening the answer was positive. However, when asked to participate few questions came up: 
       <strong>Pain points: </strong>The most recurrent one was the need for immediate directions, infos and contacts. 
       <strong>Food for thoughts:</strong> picture create a buzz, perhaps it might be worth considering adding more images of the events (either in news or the event itself). <br/><br/>

      <strong>Task 3</strong>: How to get involved? Whether through subscription or donation, the main response was that there should be more informations on what are the funds used for. 
     <strong>Food for thoughts:</strong> Use an engaging way to communicate how the funds have and will be used and how can people get involved/reach out.
