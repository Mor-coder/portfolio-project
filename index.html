          <p>
            <strong>A</strong> turning point in my life happened when I have
            been introduced to the notion that in art (although this can be
            applied to other disciplines as well), there isnâ€™t a right or wrong
            answer, but rather, different interpretations.<br /><br />

            All of a sudden, an honest dialogue was possible, and the exchange
            of ideas with the people around me became more exciting as I was
            eager to know all the different perceptions on whatever matter we
            were discussing. I was learning and growing. <br /><br />

            This was incredibly important because it allowed me to shut down my
            ego and try to look at reality through the lenses of people coming
            from different backgrounds, cultures, or ages. It taught me how to
            listen and build a genuine curiosity and empathy.<br /><br />

            Today, when approaching a new project, I ask myself the same
            questions. I wonder what makes the product important and how it is
            perceived by different people. What is it that I am missing because
            I canâ€™t see it but someone else can? No wonder brain mapping is one
            of my favourite activities throughout the design process!
            <br /><br />

            Last but not least, I am a BIG fan of products that activate people,
            that make them ask questions as opposed to provide answers. I firmly
            believe that it is possible to make accessible products, itâ€™s just a
            matter of pushing the right buttons.
