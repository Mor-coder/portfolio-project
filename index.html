            <strong>Objectives:</strong> Enhancing the charity's online
            visibility and increase traffic, thereby bringing attention and
            further value to its activities.

          <p>
            The Bramcote Old Church Tower Trust is a charity dedicated to the
            preservation of the church Tower, the sole survivor of the original
            12th-century church in Bramcote, Nottingham. <br />
            <br />
            I took it upon myself to re-design the charity's website with the
            aim to boost its online traffic and increase visibility. I think
            it's important to know & understand our past to make more conscious
            decisions for a better (present &) future.

          <p class="WorkSpecs">

          <p>
            I took the challenge to design the booking process of my dream hotel
            after having had tricky experiences with hotel booking before. I
            found it quite annoying when businesses aren't transparent about
            their offerings so I wanted to take the leap and see how I would do
            it if I had a hotel. Actually, a boutique hotel.

          </p>
          <p>
            Coding a weather app with React was actually a nice experience as
            creating components and assembling them together feels more natural
            and easy than writing a never-ending code. While user testing
            provided a good indication of what are the "must have" features of a
            weather app, I still would like to experiment with other options
            that might be more fun than functional.
