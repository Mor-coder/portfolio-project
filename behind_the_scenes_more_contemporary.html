          <p>
            Mor.e Contemporary was born from the desire to show the projects and
            collaborations I have worked on together with a varied group of
            artists. As the identity of Mor.e Contemporary changed over time,
            one of the main difficulties I encountered was having an honest and
            unfiltered conversation with myself. In other words, to truly
            understand what I wanted to gain out of it, what I wanted to show,
            and how I intended to do it.
          </p>
          <h2>Who's my target audience?</h2>
          <p>
            Having worked in the art industry for some times, I knew that my
            target audience could have been quite variegated. Although it is a
            bit of a stereotype, it is true that "art people" do not tend to be
            the most tech-friendly ones and so a clear, straight forward, and
            minimal design was necessary to make their interaction with the
            website nice and friendly.<br /><br />
            Obviously there are exceptions like art people working with digital
            media whose knowledge and ability to navigate any digital platform
            goes above and beyond the imaginary.<br /><br />
