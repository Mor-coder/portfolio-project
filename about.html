              ending...well, actually it doesn't have an end (yet)!. However,
              you can rest assured that it is full of trials and errors,
              certainties and doubts, ups and downs. Perhaps some people will
              relate to it. Either way this is how it goes... <br /><br />

              Some people seem to know exactly what they want to do in life.
              Well, that person wasn't me. I wanted to do so many things I
              didn't even know where to start but, above all, I wanted to do
              something that would make me happy and satisfied.

            <p class="p-about-me">
              My adventure kicked off with a BA in interactive communication at
              the Interdisciplinary Center Herlziya (ISR), where the door to the
              fascinating world of human-machine interaction has been opened in
              front of me. <br /><br />That was mindblowing and yet, I still
              felt like I was missing something so I move to the smoky London
              looking for fortune. There I approached the creative, yet
              structured, world of graphic design which led me to what it would
              be a full immersion into the art world.
            </p>
            <p class="p-about-me">
              Since then it has been a roller coster of experiences covering
              varied roles within the art galleries/events circuit. Despite the
              wonderful experience, I was missing the connection and challenge
              of trying to solve problems related to people as individuals and
              as a whole, with the help of technologies.

              Sometimes, you come across a sentence in a book and those few
              words simply blow up your mind as they open your eyes to new
              perspectives that you just didn't see before. And yet, they are so
              true and so common.
              <br /><br />
              Understanding this for what they mean, as opposed to what they
              are, it's one of those. For me at least. When applied to the field
              of UX design, for instance, it helped me
              <strong>emphatise</strong> with the people I was designing the
              application or website for. I wasn't only thinking of creating an
              interactive, intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing object, all of
              a sudden I was thinking about what that would mean for them. What
              were the feelings connected to the need the app or website was
              answering. Everything became a little bit deeper, way more
              interesting.
