              ending...well, it doesn't have an end (yet)!. Nevertheless, you
              can rest assured that it is full of trials and errors, certainties
              and doubts, ups and downs. Perhaps some people will relate to it.
              Either way this is how it goes... <br /><br />

              Some people seem to know exactly what they want to do in life.
              Well, that person wasn't me. I wanted to do something that would
              make me happy and satisfied with myself, which is insanily hard
              when you are a painfully perfectionist virgo aka the most severe
              judge of yourself!.
              <br /><br />
              My adventure kicked off at the Interdisciplinary Center Herlziya
              (ISR), where the door to the fascinating world of human-machine
              relationship has been opened in front of me. That was mindblowing
              and yet, I still felt like I was missing something so I moved to
              the smoky London looking for fortune. There I met the creative,
              yet structured, world of visual communication aka graphic
              design-ish. I loved it and hated it, if it possible but more so, I
              was craving something more rebellious, alternative, underground,
              bohemian, so I immersed myself in the world of fine art...What a
              marvellous clich√©!(Yes, I can hear you laughing and I am laughing
              with you!). Nevertheless, I did learn a thing or two and add them
              to the bucket of lessons I've been carrying with me since 1988.

              Since then it has been a roller coster of experiences covering
              varied roles within the art world, going back to study and so on
              and so forth. And yet, without that I wouldn't be here and you
              wouldn't be reading the drama of my life (can't help my dramatic
              Italianess from coming out) so Happy Days!

              Sometimes, you come across a sentence in a book and those few
              words open up your mind to new perspectives that you just didn't
              see before. That's why reading provides a different experience
              from listening to music or watching something. It's a matter of
              time you give yourself to appreciate and makes yours what someone
              else has suggested to you.
              <br /><br />
              To understand things for what they mean, as opposed to what they
              are, it's one of those. For me at least. It gave me a new
              perspective on almost everything, probably everything. What's a
              website? Or a pen? Or a friend? They're not just a digital page,
              or ink in a plastic tube, or flesh and blood. They are also
              sources of information (and knowledge and power), a way to express
              yourself, a safe place.
