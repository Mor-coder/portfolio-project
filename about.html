              <strong>SPOILER ALERT:</strong> This story contains very human and
              very intense experiences. Or at least it felt like it at the time,
              then I grew older and understood that it is all quite common and
              natural. It doesn't have an end (yet) but you can rest assured it
              is full of trials and errors, certainties and doubts, ups and
              downs, and so on and so forth... <br /><br />
              Some people seem to know exactly what they want to do in life.
              Well, that person wasn't me. I wanted to do so many things I
              didn't even know where to start but, above all, I wanted to do
              something that would make me happy and satisfied.

            <p class="p-about-me">
              My academic adventure kicked off with a BA in interactive
              communication at the Interdisciplinary Center Herlziya (ISR),
              where the door to the fascinating world of human-machine
              interaction has been opened in front of me. <br /><br />That was
              mindblowing and yet, I still felt like I was missing something so
              I move to the smoky London looking for furtune. There I approached
              the creative, yet structured, world of graphic design which led me
              to what it would be a full immersion into the art galleries
              circuit.
            </p>
            <p class="p-about-me">
              Since then it has been a roller coster of experiences covering
              varied roles within the art world. Despite the wonderful
              experience, I was missing the challenge of trying to solve human
              problems with the help of technologies, started in my college
              years.

              This pearl of wisdom from the book "Zen and the art of motorcycle
              maintenance" blew my mind and gave me a new perspective on how to
              approach design for people. An app, for instance, can be seen as a
              technical device providing us with X and Y information and that is
              pretty much it. <br /><br />
              To the same perception, it can be added the emotional factor. What
              are the needs the app is answering to and what are the feelings
              and emotions surrounding our needs? <br /><br />
              If it is a weather app, for instance, we might be looking at it
              because we need to know how man layers we need to out on before we
              leave the nest for the day, or we might be planning a day out
              (yay!), or a birthday party at the park (which might be moved to
              the pub if the weather is variable as the British one). All these
              factors must be taken into account when designing an app as we,
              human beings, are emotional creatures and driven by feelings other
              than reason.
