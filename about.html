              very intense experiences. Or at least it felt like it at the time,

            <p class="p-about-me">
              My academic adventure kicked off with a BA in interactive
              communication at the Interdisciplinary Center Herlziya (ISR),
              where the door to the fascinating world of human-machine
              interaction has been opened in front of me. <br /><br />That was
              mindblowing and yet, I still felt like I was missing something so
              I move to the smoky London looking for furtune. There I approached
              the creative, yet structured, world of graphic design which led me
              to what it would be a full immersion into the art galleries
              circuit.
            </p>
            <p class="p-about-me">
              Since then it has been a roller coster of experiences covering
              varied roles within the art world. Despite the wonderful
              experience, I was missing the challenge of trying to solve human
              problems with the help of technologies, started in my college
              years.
