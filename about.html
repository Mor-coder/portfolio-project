              doubts, ups and downs. Perhaps some people will relate to it.

              Some people seem to know exactly what they want to do in life.
              Well, that person wasn't me. I wanted to do so many things I
              didn't even know where to start but, above all, I wanted to do
              something that would make me happy and satisfied of myself, which
              is insanily hard when you are the most severe judge of yourself!.

              My adventure kicked off with a BA in interactive communication at
              the Interdisciplinary Center Herlziya (ISR), where the door to the
              fascinating world of human-machine interaction has been opened in
              front of me. <br /><br />That was mindblowing and yet, I still
              felt like I was missing something so I moved to the smoky London
              looking for fortune. There I enrolled in a Pg.Dip (although we
              will see later that I only gained a Pg.Cert) the creative, yet
              structured, world of graphic design. The grid system killed me, I
              now understand it but back then it killed me so slowly but surely
              I started navigating towards the unstransparent, eccentric, and
              utterly fascinating world of street and contemporary art.

              Since then it has been a roller coster of experiences covering
              varied roles within the art galleries/events circuit. Despite the
              wonderful experience, I was missing the connection and challenge
              of trying to solve problems related to people as individuals and
              as a whole, with the help of technologies.

              Sometimes, you come across a sentence in a book and those few
              words open up your mind to new perspectives that you just didn't
              see before.
              <br /><br />
              To understand things for what they mean, as opposed to what they
              are, it's one of those. For me at least. When applied to the field
              of art or UX design, for instance, it helps me emphatise with the
              people I design the website, or app, for. I am not just thinking
              of creating an interactive, intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing
              object, I also take into account what the object mean; what are
              the feelings connected to the need fulfilled by the object.
              Incorporating the human element to the design process makes
              everything a little bit deeper, way more complicated, but
              ultimately more interesting and fun.
