            <h1 class="h1-about-me">My story</h1>
            <p class="p-about-me">
              <strong>SPOILER ALERT:</strong> This story contains very human and very intense experiences. Or at least it felt like it at the time, then I grew older and understood that it is all quite common and natural. It doesn't have an end (yet) but you can rest assured it is full of trials
              and errors, certainties and doubts, ups and downs, and so on and so forth... <br /><br />
              Some people seem to know exactly what they want to do in life. Well, that person wasn't me. I wanted to do so many things I didn't even know where to start but, above all, I wanted to do something that would
              make me happy and satisfied.
            </p>
            <p class="p-about-me">
              My academic adventure kicked off with a BA in interactive communication at the Interdisciplinary
              Center Herlziya (ISR), where the door to the fascinating world of human-machine interaction has been opened in front of me. That was mindblowing and yet, I still felt
              like I was missing something. I needed to pursue my artistic side, hence the move to the smoky London.
            </p>
            <p class="p-about-me">
              There I immersed myself in the world of graphic design and everything needed to fit into the "grid". Apart for me, I felt a bit constraint. I preferred to get my hand dirty and spending time in the freezing cold letter press and screenprint labs. It worked out well as that randomly took me to Stoke Newington where I landed on my first job in an art gallery, Hang-Up Gallery. 
            </p>
            <p class="p-about-me">
              And then, I did it again, I wanted more. I wanted to keep on learning. I enrolled in the MA in contemporary art at Sotheby's Institute of Art, and really took on Edward Said's lesson on the importance of looking at culture through their own eyes, as opposed to our own perception. <br/></br/>This led to the topic of my dissertation on the human-machine relationship, in which I argued that we should look at it from a different perspective and appreciate how machines can improve our lives as opposed to threaten it.
            </p>
            <p class="p-about-me">
              From here it followed a roller coster of work experiences that never quite made me feel fulfilled. The were lacking empathy, creativity, and the push to think out of the box. So I reversed my journey, looked back, took the valid lessons with me, and started again as a multidisciplinary woman interested in UX/UI design with a decent coding knowledge.
