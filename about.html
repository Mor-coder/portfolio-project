              Some people seem to know exactly what they want to do in life.
              Well, that person wasn't me. My background is a roller coster of
              experiences within the art industry, and the strenuous pursue of a
              job that would make me feel satisfied with myself.
              <br /><br />
              Nevertheless, it all led me to gain the courage to start anew and
              take with me valuable lessons. Art thaught me to look at the
              context in which an artwork has been created to fully appreciate
              the meaning behind it, and that there isn't a right or wrong
              answer but interpretations of the same work. This is what I took
              with me when I switched to UX design and coding. I feel that to
              create meaningful experiences you got to understand the context,
              the people, and the issues involved. Coding, really, came along as
              I felt that using platforms already providing websites' structure
              was a bit like cheating. I needed to grasp the languages behind
              websites to provide better, more engaging, and creative
              experiences.

              Sometimes, you come across a sentence in a book, or the lyrics of
              a song, or a scene in a movie that opens up your mind to
              perspectives that you just didn't see before. The time and form
              each media takes, provides a different experience, and as unique
              individuals, each experience speak to us in unique ways.
              <br /><br />
              To understand things for what they mean, as opposed to what they
              are, it's one of those. For me at least. It gave me a new
              perspective on almost everything, probably everything. What's a
              website? Or a pen? Or a friend? They're not just a digital page,
              or ink in a plastic tube, or flesh and blood. They are also
              respectively a source of information (and knowledge and power), or
              a way to express yourself, or a safe place.
